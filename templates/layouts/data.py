Because shipping costs are a major expense, management is investigating a way to reduce them. Because of the world-wide pandemic, an estimate has been created as to the total output needed from each manufacturing plant and how each warehouse will require satisfying its customers. The CIO from DIVOC has created a spreadsheet of the shipping costs from each manufacturing plant to each warehouse as a baseline analysis.'
