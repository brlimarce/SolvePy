## **Solvers üîπ**
- **QSI Solver.** This is a generic solver using **Quadratic Spline Interpolation (QSI).** Based on the independent and dependent vectors as well as the x-value, this solver provides the interpolating polynomials and approximate value.

- **Simplex Solver.** This is a generic solver using the **Simplex Method.** Based on the objective function and constraints, this solver provides the final tableau, basic solution, and optimal value using maximization or minimization.

- **Problem Solver.** This is a problem-specific solver using the **Simplex Method.** Similar to its generic counterpart, it displays the final tableau, basic solution, and optimal value based on data from the table. However, it also provides the number of shipped items from each plant to each warehouse that follows the maximized or minimized cost.
