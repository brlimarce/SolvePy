## **Solvers üîπ**
- **QSI Solver.** This is a generic solver using **Quadratic Spline Interpolation (QSI).** It displays the interpolating polynomials, intervals, and approximate value based on the given data.

- **Simplex Solver.** This is a generic solver using the **Simplex Method.** It displays the final tableau, basic solution, and maximized or minimized value based on the provided objective function and its constraints.

- **Problem Solver.** This is a problem-specific solver using the **Simplex Method.** Similar to its generic counterpart, it displays the final tableau, basic solution, and optimal value based on the data from the table. This also provides a table of the number of shipped items from each plant to each warehouse to follow the maximized or minimized cost.
